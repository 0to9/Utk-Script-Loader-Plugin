 *  - $PATH gives a relative path for this script file
 *  - $getRelative(..) converts the given file path from one
 *                     relative to this script file to a
 *                     relative path that can be used by Java
 *                     for loading other files
 *  - $ifIncluded(..) compiles the code enclosed in {} if and
 *                    only if the specified id is valid from
 *                    an #include statement in this script file
 *  - $ifNotIncluded(..) compiles the enclosed code if the id
 *                       is not valid -> see $ifIncluded(..)
