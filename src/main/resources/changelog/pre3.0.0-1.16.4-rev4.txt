More Modules
Entity Protection Services is now in
EPS also received some minor back-end upgrades and a slightly modified command argument system

Scripting Changes
The scripts have received minor format revisions
These are mainly targeted for aesthetics with the Atom document editor
Scripts are hard to work with, but the C++ syntax highlighter provided by Atom works wonders for increasing readability
These internal reformats are to improve support for Atom's default auto-indent feature (with a tab-indent of 3 spaces as the standard)
