1.16.4 API Patch
Quick and dirty patches to compile with the new 1.16.4 API.... it's been a while
Added some 1.16 stuff like piglins, nether wood, netherite, and soul lanterns

Changelog Entries
I think I missed a few versions while working on internal stuff...
Also, I flipped the version order to emphasize the plugin version over Minecraft's version

Future Plans
A major update to the plugin is in progress, which is why this current version is so scuffed

And More Good News /s
The autocrafter is disabled because it's broken (probably because of messy internal refactors)
Hopefully the upcoming plugin revamp can do something about it (and that's wishful thinking not developer hints...)
