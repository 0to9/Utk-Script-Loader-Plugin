Robust Error Reporting
The plugin now reports errors and logged messages to console (configurable) and dumps a full report of all such events to a logs folder (currently not configurable, with no plans underway)
This will help significantly, both for debugging issues with the plugin itself and with custom scripts (scripts can use this reporting system too!!)

Bug Fixes Galore
Apparently the class loading in use by the plugin was severely messed up
This problem is now fixed (with lots of help from the new error reporting system).... scripts should actually load in now
