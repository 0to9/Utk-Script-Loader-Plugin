Created the `Better Enchanting' Module
Encapsulates the old `Better Mending' Module
Will hold all enchantment related changes

Added the `Better Anvils' Module under the `Better Enchanting' Module
Anvils can now perform repairs and upgrades that cost up to 1000 levels as opposed to the default of 40
In order to get rid of the now incorrect <RESET><RED>Too Expensive<> warning, use a client-side mod such as `Fix Anvils' for the Fabric Mod Loader
