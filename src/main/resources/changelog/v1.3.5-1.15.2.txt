Fixed Bugs in /craft and the `Better Mending' Module

Updated the `Movable Tile Entities' Module
Pistons can now move tile entities when powered directly via redstone, repeaters, comparators, or redstone torches
Planned additions include support for slime/honey and other redstone components such as observers

Gave Public Access to /version and Created /changelog
