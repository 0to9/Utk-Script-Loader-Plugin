To customize or configure which modules are active, simply comment or
uncomment individual '#include' statements corresponding to each module.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY PORTION OF THIS SCRIPT FILE OR ANY OTHER SCRIPT FILES
EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED BY COMMENTS. DOING SO MAY CAUSE BREAK THE SCRIPT.

thoroughly and are confident in your abilities to successfully modify the script.
